# ################### #

Every contribution added to this project with a commit must follow this nomenclature :

- [*action*] : All commit must begin with an opening hook '[', then specify the action of the changes, lastly a closing hook ']'.

## Types of actions

- `ADD` : new file/code has been added.
- `FIX` : code that wasn't working has been fixed.
- `EDIT` : modify the code but not a fix (a refactor).
- `DELETE` : remove useless or not-working code/file.
- `MERGE` : merge branch.

## Comments

After the hooks specification, add a comment to precise what you were working on.
